vim_config
==========
my personal vimrc file and some vim plugin.

### how does it works?

- **windows**: 
	- copy the _vimrc file to "c:\program files(x86)\vim" override the origin _vimrc file.
	- copy the vimfiles folder to "c:\program files(x86)\vim" override the origin vimfiles folder.
- **linux**:   
	- copy the _vimrc to "~/" and rename it as .vimrc
	- copy the files under folder to the "~/.vim" folder.

### how will vim look like?

your vim will change to be like below:
